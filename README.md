# Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to track the algorithms I am working on and to track changes as they are updated and improved over time. 
If you have any feedback, issues, or uses you would like to share please do so.

Likely to 'translate' the algorithms into the three languages I am currently studying: C, Java, and Python  
More to come...
